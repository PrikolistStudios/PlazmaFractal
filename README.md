Generate simple stochastic fractal &mdash; see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) and [video preview](https://youtu.be/jJ0ygnzTLjs).

It can be used to generate simple landscapes and noisy heightmaps.

Here you can only find the code for the project, and no build instructions or anything. This was not a concern when I developed this project and is not a concern for me now.
